# 2081. Sum of k-Mirror Numbers
Hard
---
A k-mirror number is a positive integer without leading zeros that reads the same both forward and backward in base-10 as well as in base-k.

For example:

- 9 is a 2-mirror number. Its representation in base-10 is 9, and in base-2 is 1001, both of which are palindromes.

- 4 is not a 2-mirror number because its base-2 form is 100, which is not a palindrome.

Given the base k and the number n, return the sum of the n smallest k-mirror numbers.

# Example 1
Input: k = 2, n = 5  
Output: 25  
Explanation:  
The 5 smallest 2-mirror numbers and their base-2 representations are:

  base-10    base-2  
    1          1  
    3         11  
    5         101  
    7         111  
    9        1001  

Sum = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25.
